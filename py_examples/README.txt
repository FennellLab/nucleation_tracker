#  About the Nucleation Tracker program
1. We can analyze the topology of water network by enumerating the closed rings formed through hydrogen bondings between water molecules. 
2. Additionally, we can also determine the structural ordering of pure water using . . .
   a) tetrahedral order parameter
   b) ring summation factor
      Exceptions to RSF calculation: RSF is not calculated in directional ring or unprunned ring enumeration.
      Mathematically: RSF = # of rings / optimum # of H-bonds

#  Installation
-> 'nucleation_tracker.py' is a python-based program that requires loading python version-3 or higher before executing it.

#  README files
-> We have separately included the README files for liquid water and ice crystals for enumerating rings and order parameter separately.
